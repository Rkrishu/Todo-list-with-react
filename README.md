Creating a todo list app using React involves developing a user interface that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Here's a basic definition to guide you:

##Todo List App with React:
A Todo List App developed using React is a web application designed to help users organize and manage their tasks or to-do items in an efficient and user-friendly manner. React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is employed to create a dynamic and responsive UI that seamlessly updates as users interact with the app.

##Key Features:

##1. Task Management:
Users can add new tasks, providing a title or description for each task.
Tasks can be marked as completed or pending, allowing users to track their progress.

##2. Task Display:
The app displays the list of tasks in an organized and easy-to-read format.
Completed tasks may be visually differentiated from pending tasks for clarity.

##3. Task Modification:
Users can edit task details, such as the title or description, to reflect any changes.
Tasks can be removed or deleted when they are no longer relevant.
